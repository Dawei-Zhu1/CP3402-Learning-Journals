whose system kernel is open-sourced and free. Therefore, any user can modify it to realize different functionalities.
A lot of professionals and amateurs have formed a community for developing and maintaining Linux.
Due to its stability, reliability and its economy, quite a few servers running on Linux.

### Why CLI

There are a range of varieties of Linux, for example, Ubuntu, Red-Hat and Free BSD.
Some of them are with GUI, but for server, it is recommended to use a command line version of Linux,
since there is no need to assign too many compute resources on rendering GUI on a server.

### Bash

A linux system, by default, is implemented with a Bash script parser.
With bash, a user can operate Linux system to process their command,
for example, to **r**ead, **w**rite, **e**xecute, **ch**ange **mod**e of the file, etc.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

In this course, I found our video is outdated, since some key resources listed in slides are unavailable.
I applied an AWS server, I attempted to set up some of the necessary components (EC2, Virtual Machine
router table and security group). I can open the virtual machine running on AWS Linux and have tried
creating/overwriting an HTML
containing "Hello World" into its /var/www/html with this command:

```bash
<h1>Hello from Dawei\'s Web Server!</h1></html>" > /var/www/html/index.html
```

I can also accomplish it via the SFTP protocol.

To avoid having connectivity issue due to unforeseen natural disasters, such as the cyclone in last trimester, 
I installed XAMPP on my laptop.
