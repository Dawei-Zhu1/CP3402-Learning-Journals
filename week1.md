## Learning Activities & Resources

This is my first week in this course. I reviewed quite a lot of knowledge learnt in the Webpage design. After watching LinkedIn Learning courses, I built some pages according to the requirements of the practical. I also tried different technologies in this practical. I inserted a Google Maps widget and tried different schemes for my page.

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) is a well-known webpage framework. Since I have used it frequently, I replaced it with Bulma this time.

[Bulma CSS](https://bulma.io) is also a framework.

## Estimated Hours

I planned to spend 3 hours of time this week on designing and learning, but actually, I spent 4. Excluded the time on the assignment.

## Content Insights

It is a good chance for me to recollect my webpage design skills as a warm-up process, which concreted my foundation. Learning Bulma was a challenge and benefit, as it was new to me. To learn how to use Bulma, it took me some extra time to form a perfect appearance for my website. I also observed how differently it worked compared to Bootstrap.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

While working on the practical, I was very curious about the CSS selector rules. After building up the webpage, I searched more about the use of CSS selector. Then, I found some examples used by pros. Using the selector in a smart way, I was able to apply the style correctly while keeping the CSS file clean and neat. It also helps enhance the readability of code, which is quite important for one who works on a large project. I consider my current learning strategy to be benign. In the rest of the trimester, I will adhere to the requirements in the study calendar, utilise the resources provided, and discover stable and efficient ways to accomplishment.
