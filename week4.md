## Learning Activities & Resources

To concrete my knowledge, I scanned all the videos from

1. previous lectures and
2. learning journals,

Took me around 2 hours.

There are other resources like

    - [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XAMPP)
- Wordpress

## Content Insights

Deployment is a crux in web development.
Resemble to planting trees or flowers,
a gardener (developer) must help the seeds (source code) to acclimatize to the environment.
Similarly, in web development, developers need to configure
based on the needs of clients and the actual situation.
Which means, different budgets, features, and traffic will lead to different environment.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

In the most ideal case, web developers set up at least three servers, which are:

- Staging server (For testing and to wait for client's review)
- Local deployment server (For developers to modify the site)
- Production server (To publish)

The three servers are very effective to ensure that the development, debugging and operation of the website can be
carried out smoothly. However, in practice, there may be different situations. For example, large enterprises often have
multiple websites and multiple parallel servers running in parallel. In this case, I need to think about how to deploy
in a multi-server environment. I think learning these things is very necessary for my future career.
