### About Linux

We are using bash on Linux virtual machine in this course. Linux is one of the most used operating system in the world,
whose system kernel is open-sourced and free. Therefore, any user can modify it to realize different functionalities.
A lot of professionals and amateurs have formed a community for developing and maintaining Linux.
Due to its stability, reliability and its economy, quite a few servers running on Linux.

### Why CLI

There are a range of varieties of Linux, for example, Ubuntu, Red-Hat and Free BSD.
Some of them are with GUI, but for server, it is recommended to use a command line version of Linux,
since there is no need to assign too many compute resources on rendering GUI on a server.

### Bash

A linux system, by default, is implemented with a Bash script parser.
With bash, a user can operate Linux system to process their command,
for example, to **r**ead, **w**rite, **e**xecute, **ch**ange **mod**e of the file, etc.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

In order to get closer to the formal working environment, I applied for AWS in addition to local deployment.
I reckon this is a beneficial exercise for the back-end development of my website.
I attempted to set up some of the necessary components (EC2, Virtual Machine router table and security group).
I can open the virtual machine on AWS Linux and have tried creating/overwriting an HTML
containing "Hello World" into its /var/www/html with this command:

```bash
"<h1>Hello from Dawei\'s Web Server!</h1></html>" > /var/www/html/index.html
```

I still remember that when I used the command line for the first time, I felt very uneasy and strange.
The reason for these feelings is that I was used to using the graphical interface before.
But all along, my way to overcome such kind of uncertainty is to discover the unknown actively.
So I learned to use CLI by reading Linux's manual and W3C.
In addition, I found that the use of CLI is very conducive to automation,
these aspects are of great benefit to the back-end designers of the website:
since all commands are entered by ascii characters,
which makes it easy and efficient to implement operations through scripts.
