# Week 9 - Starter Themes: Underscore_s vs Understrap

## Learning Activities & Resources

Here are the resources I used to help me understand and compare different WordPress starter themes:

1. JCU lecture recordings and slides
2. [Underscore_s](https://underscores.me/)
3. [Understrap Documentation](https://docs.understrap.com/#/)
4. [Bootstrap 5 documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/)

## Content Insights

This week, we explored the differences between two widely used WordPress starter themes:
Underscore_s and Understrap.
Both themes are designed to help developers build custom WordPress themes from scratch.
However, their features and level of built-in styling are quite different.

### Underscore_s

Underscore_s is an ultra pure starter theme created by the WordPress community.
It offers a clean, plain foundation for developers who want full control over design and layout.
Therefore, no CSS frameworks is included. We have to spend a lot of time to customize the theme.

### Understrap

Understrap is built based on Underscore_s and integrates Bootstrap,
one of the most popular front-end frameworks.
This combination gives developers a quick start in both layout and styling.

### Why we choose Understrap

Our team compared both themes and decided to move forward with Understrap.
Since we are already familiar with Bootstrap, 
and its responsive design system saves us a lot of time.
Instead of coding all styles and layouts manually,
we can use pre-made classes like `container`, `row`, and `col-*`.
This means we can focus more on WordPress logic and content management, 
rather than building the layout from scratch.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Starter themes are valuable tools in a web developer’s toolkit.
Choosing the right one can significantly impact project speed, 
code maintainability, and collaboration.

While Underscore_s gives full flexibility,
it also demands a lot more effort — suitable for developers who want full freedom of creativity.
On the other hand, Understrap is more practical for group projects and client work
due to its integrated Bootstrap features.

In real-world development, balancing control and efficiency is crucial.
By using Understrap, we are building our project in a way that reflects
how many professional developers work — using frameworks to improve consistency and speed.

I now have a deeper understanding of how starter themes work,
and how they can be adapted to fit different needs.
This knowledge will definitely help me in future roles where I need to choose or build themes from scratch.
