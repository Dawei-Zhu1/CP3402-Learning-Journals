## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

During this presentation, my presentation skills was further enhanced.

I divide the entire presentation into two parts:
the foreground and the background.
**Foreground** is the performance,
whilst the background is the organization and management of the presentation.
After participating in the presentation,
I still found myself not good at expressing myself,
I have been continuously improving in this area all along.
Although I had prepared an outline before giving the speech,
once the presentation began, my memory suddenly went blank.
I have to repeat practicing.
Although I still haven't achieved the performance I was satisfied with,
I successfully completed the entire presentation.

All along, the tasks I have been involved in has been on the background.
On the one hand, it was a bit relaxed to me
since I don't have to face to the audience directly.
On the other hand, it was also critical to our group performance.
We organized the structure of the delivery,
and helped the team configure the recording environment rapidly.
Eventually, our team successfully completed the presentation with our IT skills.

In conclusion, I ameliorate and practised my presentation skills through this event.
These experience will act a critical role in and benefit our career.
I plan to conduct further research on English in order to better handle presentations in my future career.
