## Week2 - Learning Activities & Resources

In week 2, I start to learn the concepts of two types of webpage and CMS. Firstly, I recollect the concepts of static and dynamic website. Then I searched and read some materials to consolidate those knowledge I've learnt. After that, I studied how to configure the CMS to startup my own content. The following section contains all the materials I used in this week, which may be also helpful for our assignments.

## Content Insights
### Static & Dynamic
In our daily life, it is indispensable to use the Internet to learn a variety of knowledge. Websites are built up with a wide range of purposes and technologies. In very early age, most websites were only used for content demonstration, which could be regard as a single-way user experience in a short time period. A static website will not alter its content until the developers do. Around mid-1990s, with the evolution of new technics, dynamic websites were brought into the sight. It allows users to interact with the server directly and to view changes instantly. But just like a double-edged sword, the convenience also reveal its vulnerability. I find it can be abused by hackers to commit crime by uploading malicious code to the server. When I work on my projects, I will definitely apply mechanisms to prevent my website and server being exploited. For example, changing default password for my server and database, using *htmlspecialchars()* in php to transcribe the text, etc. 

### CMS
**C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystem allows developers to manage contents easily, as a result, it speeds up the process of creating a website. Since it groups the resources orderly, collaborating on a server with CMS can be efficient. Also, it is economic to use it for business. But sometimes, the CMS may require extra features to the server. Moreover, based on my practice, it may limited customization for some platforms.


## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Nowadays, both static and dynamic websites continue to play essential roles. While However, most modern websitesâ€”especially those developed by businesses and individuals aiming for timely updates and interactive features lean towards dynamic, CMS-driven platforms due to their flexibility and ease of use.

Working with CMS this week gave me a glimpse into industry practices. I began to understand how businesses and developers use platforms like Joomla to rapidly build and manage websites without reinventing the wheel. This experience is especially valuable for careers in web development, digital marketing, or web design.
