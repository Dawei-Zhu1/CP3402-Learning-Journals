PHP has high compatibility with almost all server OSes.
As a developer, I do not want to spend too much time
on adaption when moving my product to a new platform.
With a server configured with PHP, the migration becomes an easy thing.

PHP is very easy to use. Its keywords, data types, syntax are quite similar to other programming languages.

In the future, although new server-side programming languages may be developed, I believe that PHP will still be popular
for at least the next 10 years.
