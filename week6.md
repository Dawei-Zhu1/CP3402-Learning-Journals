## Content Insights

Daily Stand-up meeting is a type of meeting strategy for developer teams.
It is used to share and update the work between team members,
so the progress can be synchronized
while removing the hurdles on the way to the goal.

As it name suggests, the meeting will be hold every day,
with brief but efficient conversation,
which should not exceed 15 minutes.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

In IT project development, daily stand-up meeting is essential. It allows the project manager to keep track of progress,
so he can make arrangements that help the team get the job done. I am fully aware of the importance of daily standup
meetings.

Previously, I learned about design thinking that we also need daily standup meetings.
However, due to the absence of core team members, we can only held the meeting weekly.
Each meeting made our team more and more anxious,
since many designs do not meet the phase goals.
Our meeting cycle is so long, as a result, there will be a large deviation each time.
Eventually, we rushed through the project. It was really a terrible experience.

While watching the video,
I think there are a few things that need to be paid particular attention to.
For example, it is necessary to separate the responsibilities of the Scrum master
from those of the Project manager.
The Project manager asks questions of the development team members
to understand the development progress.
A Scrum master directly manages the team, assigning tasks to each team member,
and making adjustments to those tasks to ensure they're done on time.

Recognizing the importance of the daily standup meeting,
I will urge the entire team to hold it as planned.
As a result, the assignment can be better completed
and the previous experience can be avoided.
